# Roadmap: Pretty Table Explorer

## Overview

Build an interactive terminal table viewer in Rust, starting with core rendering, adding navigation controls, then PostgreSQL integration. The journey takes us from parsing piped psql output to a full interactive database explorer.

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Phases 1-4 (shipped 2026-01-14)
- ✅ **v1.1 Distribution** — Phases 5-6 (shipped 2026-01-14)
- ✅ **v1.2 Advanced Viewing** — Phases 7-10 (shipped 2026-01-16)
- ✅ **v1.2.1 Patch** — Phase 9 FIX plans (shipped 2026-01-20)
- ✅ **v1.3 Code Quality** — Phases 11-13 (shipped 2026-01-20)
